Based on the provided description for "AI agents for Shopify Stores that focus on Conversion Rate Optimization," here are the specific tech stack instructions to build this product:

The core idea is an AI-powered system that audits Shopify stores for conversion bottlenecks and automates (or suggests) improvements. This requires a robust stack for web interaction, AI/ML processing, data management, and integration with Shopify.

1. Core Application & Backend (API, Logic, AI Orchestration)

Programming Language: Python (excellent for AI/ML, web development, and large ecosystem). Alternatively, Node.js (JavaScript) for full-stack teams or Go for high performance.

Web Framework:

Python: FastAPI (for high-performance APIs), Django (for full-fledged web application with admin panel if needed), or Flask (lighter for pure API).

Node.js: Express.js (flexible API creation) or NestJS (structured, opinionated framework for enterprise apps).

Database:

Primary Data Storage (PostgreSQL): For storing user accounts, Shopify store configurations, audit reports, implemented changes, conversion data, etc. PostgreSQL offers robustness, extensibility (e.g., JSONB for flexible schema), and good geospatial capabilities if visual aspects become location-dependent.

NoSQL (MongoDB/Redis): Potentially for caching, real-time analytics data (heatmaps, user flows if ingested directly), or fast lookups of frequently accessed patterns. Redis could also manage queues for async tasks.

Message Queue (for async tasks): RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka (for higher scale/event streaming) combined with Celery (for Python) or BullMQ (for Node.js) for handling:

Background site audits.

Long-running AI analyses.

Shopify API calls (to avoid rate limits).

Screenshot processing.

Generating reports and content.

2. AI & Machine Learning Core

Large Language Models (LLMs) & Vision Models:

OpenAI GPT-4o Vision: Explicitly mentioned for analyzing layout, speed, UX, and generating improvements from screenshots/visuals. Leverage its API.

Other LLM Providers (Anthropic, Google Gemini): Consider integrating others for redundancy, cost optimization, or specific performance characteristics for text-based analysis (CTA clarity, product descriptions).

Heuristics Engine / Rule-Based System:

Implement using Python: Write functions and rules to apply standard CRO best practices based on detected issues (e.g., if a CTA is below a certain size or off-screen, flag it). This can complement LLM outputs and provide more deterministic fixes.

Consider a simpler rule engine library if complexity grows (e.g., drools-py or custom logic).

Image Processing/Computer Vision:

OpenCV & Pillow (Python): For capturing, processing, and comparing pre/post screenshots, detecting elements (CTAs, images, banners), and assessing image compression.

Playwright / Puppeteer: For programmatically visiting and capturing screenshots of Shopify stores (desktop and mobile views).

Analytics Processing:

Pandas (Python): For data cleaning, analysis, and transformation of performance data (e.g., conversion uplift).

Libraries for Heatmap/User Flow analysis (if data is raw): Potentially integrate with external analytics tools (Google Analytics, Hotjar, Clarity) via their APIs rather than processing raw heatmap data yourself. If processing raw, libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly can help visualize user behavior paths.

3. Frontend & User Interface

Admin Dashboard / Shopify Embedded App UI:

Frontend Framework: React, Vue.js, or Svelte. (React is highly popular for embedded Shopify apps).

Shopify Polaris: Shopify's component library and design system. Crucial for making the app feel native within the Shopify admin.

Deployment: Static site hosting (Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3/CloudFront) for the frontend build.

Browser Extension:

Web Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or Vue.js can also be used for browser extension UIs).

Communication: chrome.runtime.sendMessage for inter-extension communication, XMLHttpRequest or fetch for communicating with your backend API.

Permissions: Request necessary permissions like activeTab, scripting, host_permissions to interact with Shopify store pages.

4. Shopify Integration

Shopify Admin API:

Authentication: OAuth (Shopify app needs to request permissions like write_themes, read_products, read_orders etc.).

Python SDK: shopify-api-python (official library) or similar for interacting with themes, products, metafileds etc.

Key Operations:

Theme Management: Reading and modifying theme files (Liquid templates, CSS, JavaScript) using the Asset API endpoint for auto-implementation of fixes.

Webhooks: Subscribe to webhooks for store changes (e.g., theme updates, product changes) to trigger re-audits.

Shopify Liquid API / Theme Kit:

The "auto-implement fixes" directly implies manipulating Liquid code. Shopify's Admin API allows theme file manipulation, which uses Liquid.

Theme Kit (CLI tool): While more for development, understanding how Theme Kit deploys themes can inform programmatic theme modifications.

Shopify App Store Listing: Requires adherence to Shopify's app development guidelines.

5. Infrastructure & Deployment

Cloud Provider: AWS, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Microsoft Azure (choose one for consistency).

Compute:

Backend API: AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine, or Docker containers deployed on AWS ECS/EKS, GCP GKE, or a managed service like AWS App Runner, Google Cloud Run, or Render.

AI/ML Tasks: Leverage serverless functions (AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Functions) for intermittent, computationally intensive tasks (e.g., a specific AI analysis trigger), or use dedicated compute instances/GPU instances for continuous ML model inference if models are self-hosted.

Data Storage Services: AWS RDS (PostgreSQL), GCP Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL), or Azure Database for PostgreSQL.

Object Storage: AWS S3, GCP Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage for storing screenshots, reports, and generated content.

CI/CD: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, AWS CodePipeline/CodeBuild, or GCP Cloud Build for automated testing, building, and deployment.

Monitoring & Logging: Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog, ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), or cloud-native solutions (AWS CloudWatch, GCP Cloud Logging/Monitoring) to track performance, errors, and conversion uplift.

Security Considerations:

OAuth 2.0: For secure Shopify authentication.

API Key Management: Securely manage API keys for OpenAI, other services, and your own backend.

Data Encryption: Encrypt data at rest and in transit.

Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on your API and handle Shopify API rate limits gracefully.

This comprehensive tech stack addresses the requirements for building an AI-powered conversion rate optimization agent for Shopify stores, covering aspects from AI/ML to deep Shopify integration and deployment.
